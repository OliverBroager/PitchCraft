# 🎤 PitchCraft — The Fast-Paced Pitching Game

**PitchCraft** is a lighthearted browser game where you practice crafting creative startup pitches under time pressure.  
You’ll be given a random, often ridiculous product idea — like _“a smart toothbrush that gives dating advice”_ — and have **120 seconds** to write your pitch.

Then you’ll see mock competitors present their own versions, rate them, give short feedback, and watch the leaderboard update after each round.
